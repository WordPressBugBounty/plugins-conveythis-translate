== FAQ ==

= What are the minimum installation requirements for ConveyThis? =

* WordPress 4.0 or higher
* PHP version 5.3 or higher

= Can I edit my site's translations? =

Yes, you can edit the translation in your account on the [My Translations](https://app.conveythis.com/domains "My Translations") tab. All changes will be displayed on your site.

= Will the search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) and AI platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) index the translated pages? =

Of course. ConveyThis creates a unique URL-prefix based to the language selected (for example: /ru/ for Russian or /es/ for Spanish), which will be indexed by all search engines.

= Is ConveyThis Translate compatible with my theme/plugin? =

Yes! ConveyThis Translate essentially takes a "snapshot" of all the content, including meta text and other items not directly visible on the page, then uses that text data to retrieve or generate translations. By translating your site's content with this method, you never have to worry about whether changing your theme or adding a new plugin will affect the translated version of your site.

ConveyThis Translate will always be able to translate all the content on your site!

= Why don't my translations appear? =

There are three potential reasons that your translations may not appear on your website:

1. **Your plugin is not setup.** Make sure you select your site's source language (the language your text is currently written in) and then select which languages you want your site to be available in. Make sure you click the save button to complete the setup.
2. **Another script is causing a JavaScript conflict that blocks the plugin from running.** ConveyThis Translate relies on JavaScript to function, and if another plugin throws an error or other exception that prevents the JavaScript from running properly, it may cause issues with the translations being displayed. Try disabling your other plugins one at a time to see if they are causing the conflict.
3. **You have exceeded the limits of your plan.** If you add more languages than your subscription plan supports, or if you exceed the number of words or translations supported by your subscription plan, it may cause the translations to not be displayed on your site. Please view your pages and the plugin's configuration screen when logged in as an administrator and look for any error messages. You can also view your current usage statistics and related data by logging into your user account on [https://www.conveythis.com/](https://www.conveythis.com/)

= Can I bundle ConveyThis Translate with my themes? =

No, you may not bundle the ConveyThis Translate plugin with your themes without express permission.

If you are a WordPress theme developer and would like to provide ConveyThis Translate as a plugin, or have other ideas for integrating ConveyThis Translate into your products, please visit [https://www.conveythis.com/](https://www.conveythis.com/) and contact us to discuss licensing and other issues.

= Why is my text showing as ??????? (question mark characters) =

If the text on your site is displaying as ? (question mark) or square/rectangular symbols, this is typically caused by an encoding issue.

ConveyThis Translate stores translations as UTF-8 encoded string data. To make sure your text is displayed properly, your pages must also be rendered with UTF-8 encoding. You can find more details here: [https://codex.wordpress.org/Converting\_Database\_Character\_Sets](https://codex.wordpress.org/Converting\_Database\_Character\_Sets)

Also, make sure your theme's template files are save as UTF-8 encoded file types, and that your blog's header is setting the charset value to UTF-8, like so:

&lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt; or &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;

= How do I setup my server to separate languages into directories? =

Good news: this requires no additional configuration on your server!

Directory rewriting is a built-in feature that utilizes WordPress's core functionality to automatically prepend the language code to the front of your URL to differentiate your main content from your translated content.

For example, the translated versions of a page located at https://example.blog/my-first-post/ can be accessed from:

* https://example.blog/es/my-first-post/ (Spanish)
* https://example.blog/de/my-first-post/ (German)
* https://example.blog/ru/my-first-post/ (Russian)
* etc.

Make sure that you don't have directories setup on your server with the same name as the language prefixes to avoid any issues with this redirect method. Additionally, make sure that posts, pages, and other content is not setup in WordPress to use the two-letter language code for routing as well. Confirm this with your theme, any other plugins you may be running, and your blog's permalink settings.

= Will ConveyThis slow down my site? =

ConveyThis Translate will not slow down your website as it never needs to access your site's database at any time to translate your site's content!

Since translations are stored on ConveyThis server--rather than your own--you will never need to worry about optimizing your queries, clearing out old translation revisions, or other database issues. It just works!

= Why can't I save on the configuration? =

If you cannot set up the API key or select languages on the configuration page, or attempts to translate a page of your website fails, you might be running an outdated version of the plugin. Please update ConveyThis to the latest version.

= How do I find, edit, and save translated pages? =

Log in to your ConveyThis account and go to the "My Translations" tab.

To edit your translations, first choose domain name you want to edit with and select a specific page address to work on.

Here you can use Visual Editor or edit translations row by row.

= Can ConveyThis be run on localhost? =

As of version 2.7 of the plugin, ConveyThis can now be tested from localhost. Previous versions of the plugin will not work on sites hosted locally.

= How many languages does ConveyThis support? =

The number of languages available depends on the plan that you are subscribed to.

With the most advanced “Extreme plan,” you have 100 languages at your disposal.

The current number of possible languages to operate in is 200.

While this list contains all the most-spoken languages of the world, many rare dialects are not yet included.

= Is ConveyThis Translate free? =

ConveyThis Translate provides Free plan with 5,000 words and 1 language.

Users of paid plans can get their money back within the month of using the plugin you are not satisfied with the result.

= Can I migrate from WPML, Polylang or Weglot Translate? =

You can easily migrate from any translation plugin. Just deactivate the current plugin from your WP-Admin panel. ConveyThis Translate can then start working properly on your website.

= How can I set up / move the language switcher? =

If you want to customize your language switcher, first access the settings page for the plugin in wp-admin and click "Show more options".

You can choose how you want the language switcher displayed: square or round flag; with or without text in it.

You will be able to place the switcher button either at the top of the right side or at the bottom of the right side of the page. You can also move it to the center of the page or set up the spacing you want using the toggle in section labeled "Indenting".

= How do I resolve "cURL error 7: Failed to connect to api.conveythis.com port 443: Connection refused"? =

Sometimes you may experience the following error:

**[http_request_failed] cURL error 7: Failed to connect to api.conveythis.com port 443: Connection refused**

This usually means that the server cannot connect to api.conveythis.com. Possible reasons could be a firewall or your IP being blocked by ConveyThis.

Port 443 is "https", which your server may not accept. You can try to connect over "http" instead. You can also try to use a proxy server.

If you've tried all of the above and still get this error, contact us at [support@conveythis.com](mailto:support@conveythis.com).
